A C++ console game of Battleships
Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

This C++ console game consists of two modes. Computer VS Computer and Person VS Computer. When playing with the Person VS Computer mode, the player can either choose to mark his own ships on the field or the computer can do it for them. The field is 9x9 and can have this marks:

"." - the default space with or without a ship(if it’s the opponents field this indicates that you haven’t guessed this area yet);

"X" - this area has a ship;

"0" - this area had been guessed incorrectly and doesn’t have a ship in it;

"#" - this area had been guessed correctly and has a ship in it.
